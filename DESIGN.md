## Brand & Style

The design system is centered on a "Premium Dark Mode" aesthetic, designed to evoke the immersive feeling of a high-end audio studio. It targets music enthusiasts and data-driven listeners who value both aesthetic beauty and analytical depth.

The style merges **Minimalism** with **Glassmorphism**. It utilizes a deep, layered "Void" background strategy where depth is communicated through subtle shifts in dark values rather than heavy shadows. High-quality artist photography is treated as a primary UI element, often influencing the atmosphere through background blurs and tinted overlays. The emotional response is one of sophistication, focus, and rhythmic energy.

## Colors

The palette is built on a foundation of "absolute blacks" and "rich grays" to ensure the vibrant primary purple remains the undisputed focal point.

- **Primary Purple (#711EBA):** Reserved for high-intent actions, active states, and critical success indicators. It should never be used for large surfaces, only as an accent or interactive signal.
- **Surface Strategy:** The `background_canvas` (#121212) serves as the base layer. Interactive cards and containers use `surface_card` (#181818) to create subtle separation.
- **Glassmorphism:** Use semi-transparent versions of the secondary color (e.g., `#FFFFFF0D`) for glass overlays, paired with a heavy backdrop blur (20px+) to maintain legibility over vibrant album art.

## Typography

The system uses **Inter** for its systematic, clean, and highly legible characteristics. The type hierarchy relies on significant weight contrast to guide the eye.

- **Display Text:** Uses extra-bold weights and tighter letter spacing for a punchy, editorial feel on dashboards.
- **Labels:** Use uppercase for utility labels (e.g., "TOP GENRES" or time periods) to distinguish them from content.
- **Body Text:** Uses a slightly muted white (#B3B3B3) to reduce eye strain in high-contrast dark environments, while headlines remain pure white (#FFFFFF).

## Layout & Spacing

This design system utilizes a **Fluid Grid** approach with strict 8px incremental spacing to maintain rhythmic consistency.

- **Desktop:** 12-column grid with 24px gutters. Side navigation is fixed at 280px, with the main dashboard content flowing in the remaining space.
- **Mobile:** Single column with 16px margins.
- **Sectioning:** Content blocks are separated by 48px or 64px vertical margins to create "breathing room," emphasizing the premium, uncluttered nature of the app.

## Elevation & Depth

Elevation is achieved through color luminosity and **Glassmorphism** rather than traditional drop shadows.

- **Layer 0 (Canvas):** #121212.
- **Layer 1 (Cards):** #181818. Subtle 1px inner border (#FFFFFF1A) to define edges against the canvas.
- **Layer 2 (Floating/Glass):** Surfaces that float over content (like track detail modals or player bars) use a 60% opacity white fill with a `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)`.
- **Gradients:** Use soft, radial gradients (Primary Purple at 10% opacity) in the top-left corner of the canvas to suggest an ambient light source.

## Shapes

A "Rounded" shape language is used to soften the technical nature of data visualization.

- **Base Radius:** 8px for small components like buttons and inputs.
- **Large Radius:** 16px (rounded-lg) for content cards and imagery containers.
- **Extra Large Radius:** 24px (rounded-xl) for major container sections and modal wrappers.
- **Imagery:** Album art should always maintain a minimum 4px radius to avoid "sharp" corners that conflict with the overall UI.

## Components

- **Track Cards:** Utilize a vertical stack. Image at the top (16px radius), followed by title and artist. On hover, the background shifts to #282828 and a floating "Play" button (Primary Purple) appears.
- **Tabs (Time-Period Switchers):** Pill-shaped containers. Active state uses a #333333 background with white text; inactive uses transparent background with secondary text. No borders.
- **Primary Buttons:** High-contrast Purple (#711EBA) with white text, bold weight, and fully rounded (pill) ends.
- **Glassmorphic Player Bar:** Fixed to the bottom. Uses the backdrop-blur treatment. Controls are centered, with a progress bar that uses a subtle 2px height, turning purple on interaction.
- **Authentication States:** User profile images are circular (fully rounded) with a small purple status dot for "Online/Active" states.
- **Data Visualizations:** Charts should use Primary Purple for data lines/bars, with #535353 for grid lines to keep the focus on the metrics.
